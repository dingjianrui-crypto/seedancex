## ⚡ Deployment: Vercel & Production

Deploying an instance of Seedance v2.0 Generator to the web requires minimal configuration. The architecture is engineered explicitly for **Vercel** serverless environments.

### 🔑 Required Environment Variables

To successfully deploy and run, you must populate the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

| Service               | Variable                             | Description & Source                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Database**          | `DATABASE_URL`                       | PostgreSQL connection string ([Supabase](https://supabase.com) or [Neon](https://neon.tech))                                                                                              |
|                       | `DIRECT_URL`                         | Direct DB connection for Prisma migrations                                                                                                                                                |
| **NextAuth / Google** | `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`                    | Secure random string generated via `openssl rand -base64 32`                                                                                                                              |
|                       | `NEXTAUTH_URL`                       | App origin used by NextAuth redirects. Use `http://localhost:3000` locally, or your production domain (e.g. `https://my-app.vercel.app`) in production.                                    |
|                       | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`                   | Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). For local OAuth, add `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` to Authorized redirect URIs.    |
|                       | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`               | Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). If your local dev server uses another port, update the Google redirect URI origin to match that port. |
| **Stripe Billing**    | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`                  | Get from [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)                                                                                                                         |
|                       | `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Get from [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)                                                                                                                         |
|                       | `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`              | Webhook secret for resolving credit purchases. Configure Stripe to send webhooks to `http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook` locally, or `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook` in production. |
| **AI Generator**      | `ARK_API_KEY`                | Create an account and get key from [https://console.volcengine.com/home](https://console.volcengine.com/home)                                                                                                   |

For payment lifecycle tracking, configure the Stripe webhook endpoint to receive `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`, `checkout.session.expired`, and `payment_intent.payment_failed`.
